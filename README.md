# PyTorch Audio Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks designed to help users learn and practice audio processing using PyTorch and its associated library, torchaudio.


## Introduction

This repository serves as a personal learning space for exploring audio processing with PyTorch. As a student currently practicing torchaudio, I have created hands-on tutorials and examples to deepen my understanding. Each notebook focuses on a specific topic, starting from fundamental audio loading techniques to more advanced applications, such as feature extraction and neural network-based audio classification. Through these exercises, I aim to build a strong foundation in audio analysis and machine learning while sharing useful insights with others on a similar learning journey.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pytorch-audio-practice.git
